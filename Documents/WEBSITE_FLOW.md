## Website Flow & Messaging Strategy for Black Wave
Totally get the tension you’re trying to manage: **“We build hard physical things AND we think at a high analytical/GenAI level.”** Let’s bake that into Option 3 so neither side feels like the “side hustle.”

I’ll do three things:

1. Clarify the **brand message** that unites both.
2. Redesign **Option 3’s flow** around *two clear pillars*.
3. Give concrete **content & visual rules** so it never reads as “just AI” or “just a GC.”

---

## 1. Core brand message (how we talk about Black Wave)

**Positioning sentence (for top of site & LinkedIn, etc.):**

> **Black Wave is a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned construction firm that pairs proven field execution with GenAI-driven decision science to deliver better projects, faster.**

This does a few important things:

* Leads with **“construction firm”** and **SDVOB** → clearly a real-world builder.
* Uses GenAI as a **modifier** of how you operate (“pairs,” “enhances”) rather than a standalone business type.
* “Decision science” + “better projects, faster” makes AI feel practical and operational, not gadgety.

**Tagline ideas for the hero (you’d pick one style):**

* **“Building infrastructure. Engineering smarter decisions.”**
* **“Concrete results, intelligent workflows.”**
* **“Construction, logistics, and AI that work together.”**

---

## 2. Option 3, adapted: “Two Pillars” layout

Think of the homepage as a **spine with two parallel tracks**:
**Construction** and **Decision Science / GenAI**.
Both are always visible; visitors can mentally pick their lane without feeling like the other lane is noise.

### Section A – Hero (Image #1 as base)

Use the **hero blueprint/skyline image** as the main background because it screams “built environment,” not “AI startup.”

**Layout:**

* Left side (text):

  * Logo

  * Tagline (from above)

  * Short paragraph:

    > Black Wave is an SDVOB construction company specializing in complex projects and mission-critical facilities. We combine field-tested delivery with GenAI-powered planning, logistics, and decision support so owners see fewer surprises and more predictable outcomes.

  * Two CTAs side-by-side:

    * **Primary:** “Construction Services”
    * **Secondary (outline button):** “Decision & GenAI Support”

* Right side:

  * Hero image as-is, maybe very subtle overlay hinting at network/AI in the top-right, but keep **buildings and blueprints dominant**.

✅ Anyone landing here from a construction bid immediately knows: *“Yes, this is a real construction firm; the AI is a differentiator, not the product.”*

---

### Section B – “Two Pillars” band (immediately under hero)

A clear band that literally spells out your dual nature.

**Left card – Construction & Field Services**

* Title: **Construction & Field Services**
* Subtext:
  “General construction, renovations, and mission-critical facility improvements delivered by a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small business.”
* Bullets (examples):

  * Design-build and tenant improvements
  * Infrastructure, utilities, and site work
  * Federal and DoD facility projects

**Right card – Decision Science & GenAI**

* Title: **Decision Science & GenAI Enablement**
* Subtext:
  “Advanced analytics and GenAI workflows that improve planning, logistics, and project decision-making.”
* Bullets:

  * Work packaging & phasing optimization
  * Material and logistics planning
  * Executive decision dashboards & scenario analysis

Visually: same card style, same gold lines → **equally legitimate pillars.**

---

### Section C – Past Performance (centerpiece, with filters)

This is your core proof section. Keep Option 3’s idea but split projects into **two tabs** rather than two separate pages:

**Layout:**

* Section title: **Past Performance**
* Small subtitle:
  “Selected projects across construction and decision support.”

**Toggle / Tabs at top:**

* `CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS`
* `DECISION SCIENCE & GENAI PROJECTS`

Each tab shows **cards** with a consistent pattern.

**For Construction cards:**

* Project name (or anonymized title)
* Customer / Agency
* Role: Prime / Subcontractor
* Scope: “Renovation of XYZ facility, multi-phase construction in active environment.”
* Outcomes:

  * “Completed in X months with minimal downtime.”
  * “Coordinated with multiple trades and stakeholders.”

**For GenAI/Decision Science cards:**

* Engagement name
* Customer / Agency / Partner
* Focus: “Mission engineering, AI workflow design, logistics analytics.”
* Outcomes:

  * “Reduced planning cycle time by 40%.”
  * “Created reusable GenAI workflow playbook for ongoing operations.”

Below cards: a button: **“Download Capability Statement (PDF)”** – but make that doc clearly have **two sections**, same as the site.

---

### Section D – “Why These Two Together?” explainer

This is where you explicitly defuse the “knuckle dragging vs. AI hype” risk.

**Section title:**
**Why Construction and GenAI Belong in the Same Company**

Two columns with icons:

1. **Field-Driven AI, Not Hype**

   * Short paragraph about how your GenAI / decision science comes directly from field pain points: schedule risk, RFIs, logistics, change management.

2. **Smarter Projects, Not Just Smarter Slides**

   * Paragraph: your analytics work feeds back into actual jobs: better phasing, fewer delays, clearer owner communication.

Add 3 short “principles” chips:

* “Safety & quality first”
* “Evidence-based use of AI”
* “Mission-aligned, responsible tech”

---

### Section E – Services (deeper dive under each pillar)

Now that visitors know who you are and what you’ve done, you show the **menu**.

**Group 1: Construction Services**

* General construction & renovations
* Mission-critical / secure environments
* Owner’s rep / construction advisory (if you do it)

Each with: “Best for: [type of client / project]”.

**Group 2: Decision & GenAI Services**

* **Project Intelligence** – dashboards, progress analytics, risk flags.
* **Workflow Design** – SOPs embedded with GenAI support (submittals, RFIs, scheduling).
* **Strategic Support** – mission engineering, scenario analysis for programs and portfolios.

Visually: keep this section more understated on the AI side (no giant circuit head). Let the **language** carry the advanced nature.

---

### Section F – About Black Wave

Remind them of the anchor.

* Lead with: **“Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business”** and your construction roots.
* Then mention:

  * Experience with DoD / federal projects
  * Background in mission engineering, OR, AI/ML.
* A short paragraph that nails it:

  > Black Wave started as a boots-on-the-ground construction firm focused on complex projects in demanding environments. Over time, we added deep decision science and GenAI capabilities to solve persistent problems in planning, logistics, and communication. Today, we bring both disciplines to every engagement—so owners don’t have to choose between practical execution and advanced analytics.

---

### Section G – Contact / “Tell us about your project”

Keep the framing inclusive of both pillars.

* Header: **“Tell us about your project or challenge.”**
* Form fields:

  * Name / Organization / Email
  * Dropdown: **“I’m interested in:”**

    * Construction project
    * Decision / GenAI support
    * Both / Not sure yet
  * Free text: “Briefly describe your project or problem.”

This way, people self-identify but don’t feel constrained.

---

## 3. Visual & content rules so you don’t skew too far either way

Here are some simple guardrails:

1. **Hero Imagery**

   * Use **Image #1** (skyline + blueprints + interface) for the hero.
   * Keep **Image #2** (worker + AI head) for:

     * A trimmed use in the Past Performance or “Why These Two Together” section.
     * Or as a subtle background for the Decision Science tab only.
   * Avoid leading with the big AI head at the very top of the site.

2. **Language priorities**

   * On the homepage above the fold:

     * First 2–3 phrases should clearly say “construction”, “projects”, “facilities”, “field”, “SDVOB”.
   * AI/GenAI terms should appear as **enhancers**:
     “GenAI-enabled planning,” “AI-supported analysis,” not just “AI solutions.”

3. **Iconography**

   * Mix physical-world icons (cranes, buildings, blueprints, hardhat) with digital ones (nodes, networks, dashboards).
   * Never stack three AI graphics in a row without a physical counterpart.

4. **Global navigation**

   * I’d name the top nav:

     `HOME | CONSTRUCTION | DECISION & GENAI | PAST PERFORMANCE | ABOUT | CONTACT`

   * “CONSTRUCTION” and “DECISION & GENAI” can just jump to anchors on the homepage, but those labels make it **impossible** to misread your business.

---

If you’d like, next step I can:

* Turn this flow into a **concrete HTML + CSS skeleton** with section IDs, placeholder copy, and picture slots that you can drop straight into PyCharm.
* We’ll wire in your two images in the right spots and keep enough structure that expanding content (more projects, more services) won’t break the layout.
